# Project Name:
## Supplier Management

# Project Details:
This project is a final exam for Web App Development class in Assumption University, which is made for managing suppliers and their details and also adding new suppliers for a stock based idea. The details include the supplier's name, address and email, and is deployed through Vercel

# Functionality:

In this project, we are able to see a table of suppliers that have already been present in the database, furthermore, we can delete those which will also delete them from the database. And if we want to add a new supplier, we may also use the 'Add Supplier' button that further adds it to the database, along with Update that updates the present details.

This has been achieved through the help of Next.js, CSS, MongoDB, React, Express. JS and JSX is used to further use the features, and access specific suppliers that have been saved through their ids.
